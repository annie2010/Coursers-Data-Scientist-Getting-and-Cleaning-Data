## Purpose

This project intends to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The data selected for this project is about wearable computing. The data is regarding activities from volunteers such as walking, sitting, etc. Their activities are represented by measurements from accelerometers in smartphones. Activity menasurements are done and the data set is available.

The fruit of this project is to create an R script so as to process and compute all activity measurements from the original data set to produce a new, clean and tidy data set. The new data set is about average measurements regarding each voluneteer with each activity. The new data set is captured in an output file called "tidy_data.txt"
